In lieu of an opportunity to demo our project, I'm going to briefly describe the functionality of our program.
Our code has two main outputs: The 13 pre-determined charts who's data will be tweeted periodically throughout the week, and the reply feature of our code.
The reply bot acts as both a delay which enables us to control the time at which the pre-determined tweets will be sent, as well as allow users to interact with the software.
If a user wants to request the top song from a chart, they can simply tweet at us and follow the format in our pinned tweet. This will trigger one of three responses.
The first response is no reponse. This will occur if the tweet either doesn't tag our account, or doesn't include all of the keywords
The next response will occur if the user didn't format there request properly. It will tell the user that their request is invalid and ask them to re-sumibt their request
Finally, the last reply occurs when the user formats their tweet correct and tags us. This will trigger a tweet posting the number one song from that chart at that given date, along with the song's artist and any featuring artist
The code will then loop back to check if any new tweets were pulished mentioning @ChartBotProject
