In order to run and re-run the code, you're going to have to delete the tweets that have already been published. 
IF YOU DON"T THE CODE WILL NOT RUN PROPERLY!!!!
If the program tries to send a tweet that already exists, the code will break from its normal path!
To avoid this, if you re-run the code PLEASE DELETE ANY PRE-EXISTING TWEETS
